![Anarch](https://github.com/gameblabla/anarch_casloopy/blob/main/scr1.png?raw=true)

This is my attempt to port Anarch to the casio loopy so far.
It would seem the current emulator does not like some instructions generated by GCC and thus causes issues.
This will need further tests on real hardware.
